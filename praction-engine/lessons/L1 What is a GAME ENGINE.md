# What is a Game Engine?

Reference: https://thecherno.com/engine

## Game engine:
* concept
* pros and cons
* plans to cover which features

## Game engine concept
* broad definition
    * help build games quickly
    * suite of tools to help content creators to make models
    * commercialized engines (unity, unreal)
        * level editor
        * big tool
        * platform for building an application
    * game companies (EA, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Value)
        * Unreleased game engine
* Platform to construct that an visual application
    * doesn't have to be a game
    * unreal, unity 
        * VR applications
        * Architectural visualizations
        * Simulations
        * Interactions
* Game engine: an interactive visual data-oriented application

## Assets
* The game engine manages data by storing it in files called assets
* Game engines are optimized to generate these assets
* Artwork, models and other data formats must be converted into asset for the game engine to use
    * png image
    * obj models
    * levels
    * etc

## Game Production Pipeline
1. Content creator creates art
2. the game engine is used to convert art into an asset
3. the game engine reads assets at run time
4. the game engine outputs visual and receives input from user 
5. user can then interact with game engine

## Data transformation to assets
We need a number of various systems:
* platform extraction layers 
    * Generalizes code away from platform specific implementation
    * desktop (windows, mac, linux)
    * mobile (iOS, android)
    * console (Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo)
* run time transformations
    * rendering
    * audio
    * file input/output
    * serialization/parser
        * translating data into or out of marked languages
* tools
    * level editor

## Next Lesson Planning Lessons
* planned game engine features 
* plans on making each game engine feature
