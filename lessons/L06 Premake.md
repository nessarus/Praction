# Project Generation

Project generation is good to assist in generating new projects on different platforms. 
We are currently using Visual Studio on Windows (Windows Environment). We would like to add Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. 

To do this it is important to abstract the game engine out of the Windows environment and make it more generalizable.

Premake is a utility that assists in generating project files for toolsets like Visual Studio, Xcode or GNU Make. A similar program is CMake.
