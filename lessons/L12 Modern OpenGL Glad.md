Modern OpenGL (Glad)

Next steps, ImGUI running. ImGUI is a framework to get a UI fast. 

UI is important to not have to recompile code whenever we want to change a single variable. 

In the OpenGL series we used a extension called GLEW. We are going to be using GLAD. 

GLAD loads the libraries from the graphics card. 

1. We are going to configure it on the website first
2. We are going to add it as a separate project
3. Then set it up in the premake file.
