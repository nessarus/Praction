# Entry Point

What does the program do on start up? 

Today we are going to setup the sandbox's ability to use the game engine's applications. 

We will setup a game engine application class and setup the export and importing preprocessor commands.

## In Properties:
Praction:
Configuration: All Configuration
C/C++ >> Preprocessor >> add PT_PLATFORM_WINDOWS;PT_BUILD_DLL;

SandBox:
Configuration: All Configuration
C/C++ >> Preprocessor >> add PT_PLATFORM_WINDOWS;

Note: PT stands for Praction (game engine name)
